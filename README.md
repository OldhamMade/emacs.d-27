# My Emacs Config

This is the Emacs environment I use for development, tailored for Emacs 24.5.5 on OS X.

The config.org file is a literate programming document written with org-mode
and org-mode-babel. You can view config.org in a web browser on GitHub, or read 
config.org directly in Emacs.

This config is provided without warrenty or support.
